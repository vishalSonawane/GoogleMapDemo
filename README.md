# GoogleMapDemo
This demo contains Google Map SDK use to fetch our current location address, select destination address using google places and to show available routes between the source and destination.

The code is not open source. If you want to use code in your app or need any help on this, then you can contact me on vishalsonawane123@gmail.com.
